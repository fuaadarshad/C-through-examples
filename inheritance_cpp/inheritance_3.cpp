--> Banana "is a" fruit //we can think of "Banana" & "fruit" as two classes and there is a relationship between these two classes

--> if there is some relationship between two classes then it is called "ASSOCIATION"

	Types of "ASSOCIATION"

	(1) Aggregation
	(2) Composition
	(3) Inheritance --> wheresoever we can see "is a" relationship, inheritance would be present there
       	    For eg: car	"is a" vehicle --> inheritance is present
	    	    engine &  car("is a" relationship doesn't exists)	--> inheritanec not present	
		    car "has a" engine("has a" relationship exists)
 
--> "is a" relationship is always implemented as a "public" inheritance
    but why so??? for answer see "inheritance_4.cpp"

--> when to use "public/protected" inheritance --> see "inheritance_5.cpp"
