//	STL-->Standard Template Library
//
//	At the C++ STL Libraries are classified in one of the three
//	1) Containers(STORAGE)
//	2) Algorithms(PERFORMING ACTIONS)
//	3) Iterators
//
//
//	"Containers" are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind.
//	"Container library" in STL provide containers that are used to create data structures like array,linked list,trees etc.
//	These are generic i.e they can hold elements of any data types
//	Example: "vector" can be used for creating dynamic arrays of char,integer,float etc.
//
//	
//	"Algorithms" act on containers.They provide the means by which we can perform initialization,sorting,searching and transformation
//	of the content of containers.
//	"Algorithm library" contains built in functions that perform complex algorithms on the data structures.
//	"Algorithm library" provides abstraction, i.e you don't necessarily need to know how the algorithm works
//
//	
//	"Iterators" are used to step through the elements of collections of objects.These collections may be containers
//	or subsets of containers.
